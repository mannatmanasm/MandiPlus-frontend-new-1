# Changes — 2025-01-31

## Hamburger menu and policy pages

### What changed

- **Home header (`src/features/home/HomePage.tsx`)**
  - Replaced the visible "Logout" button with a **hamburger menu** icon (Bars3Icon).
  - Added a **slide-out menu panel** (from the right) with:
    - **Pricing** → `/pricing`
    - **Refund Policy** → `/refund-policy`
    - **Privacy Policy** → `/privacy-policy`
    - **Logout** (moved from header into the menu).
  - Menu opens on hamburger click; closes on overlay click or close (X) button.
  - Styling aligned with existing theme: white panel, `#4309ac` accent, `#e0d7fc` hover, Poppins, rounded corners.

- **New app routes (placeholder pages)**
  - `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` — Pricing page.
  - `src/app/refund-policy/page.tsx` — Refund Policy page.
  - `src/app/privacy-policy/page.tsx` — Privacy Policy page.

### Why it changed

- Centralize secondary actions (Pricing, policies, Logout) in one menu.
- Free header space and improve layout on smaller screens.
- Keep motion and styling consistent with the rest of the app.

### How it affects the code

- **Navigation:** Header no longer shows Logout directly; it’s under the hamburger menu with Pricing, Refund Policy, and Privacy Policy.
- **New routes:** `/pricing`, `/refund-policy`, `/privacy-policy` are valid; you can replace placeholder content with real copy.
- **No API or data changes:** Only UI and routing.

### Developer notes

- Replace placeholder content on Pricing, Refund Policy, and Privacy Policy pages when final copy is ready.
- Menu uses `transition-all duration-300 ease-out` for open/close; panel uses `translate-x` for the slide.
- Accessibility: dialog has `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-label="Menu"`; buttons have `aria-label` where needed.
